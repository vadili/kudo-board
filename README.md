### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in the labs were of great help and significantly enhanced my understanding of the projects.


* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

The time constraint for completing the project posed a significant challenge. Unfortunately, this led to a sense of rushing through tasks, impacting overall efficiency. Given more time, I would have been able to allocate resources towards refining the project's design.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Despite the time limitations, the project demo went reasonably well. There were aspirations to incorporate supplementary features, which proved challenging due to the rushed nature of the process. In future endeavors, I aim to explore more creative avenues for visual representation within projects.
